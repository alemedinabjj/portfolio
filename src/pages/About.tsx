        <p className="text-xl text-gray-50 text-center leading-6">I was born in SÃ£o Paulo, Ermelino Matarazzo, but since I've known myself, I've lived in Guarulhos. <br />

          I am 26 years old, a lot of life experience, desire to learn more and more. I am currently studying Technologist in Systems Analysis and Development, and, of course, seeking knowledge in online courses and documentation. <br /> I consider myself a nice, expressive and very contagious person.

          Basically this,

          att, Alexandre Medina </p>
          <p className="text-xl text-gray-50 text-center leading-6">
            Currently, I only have experience with personal projects, I still don't work in the area, but I certainly dream of being a front-end developer, in the not too distant future, of course.</p>
